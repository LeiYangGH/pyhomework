Each line can easily be split into a list of 'raw' words using a basic str.split(). 
Your function should then strip off the following characters from the start and end of each word, 
'\n"-:\';,.'. You can use this string when you call the .strip method. 
You don't need to strip any other characters from the start or end, ie, 
only strip off the characters provided.
