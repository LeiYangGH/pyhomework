Toby's code was rather "interesting", it had the following issues: short,
meaningless identifiers such as n1 and n; deep, complicated nesting;   
a doc-string drought; very long, rambling and unfocused functions; not 
enough spacing between functions; inconsistent spacing before and 
after operators, just like   this      here. Boy was he going to get a low
style mark.... Let's hope he asks his friend Bob to help him bring his code
up to an acceptable level.
