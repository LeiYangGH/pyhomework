|  The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived,  |
|with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little birds and beasts, |
|as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in     |
|chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the    |
|White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the     |
|other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts |
|upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--|
|`I wish they'd get the trial done,' she thought, `and hand round the           |
|refreshments!'                                                                 |
